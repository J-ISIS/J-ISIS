J-ISIS New UNESCO Java ISIS

The J-ISIS projectâ€™s mission and goals are to develop a new multiplatform 
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)  ISIS suite that would provide the same
successful concepts and functionalities as the actual UNESCO ISIS suite while
removing the restrictions, being Client/Server, UNICODE, and benefiting of the 
latest software developments. One of the objectives was also to keep the 
assets and experience of the users. But the main objective is also to develop
a long-term solution that would be modular, easy maintainable and extensible.
