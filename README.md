J-ISIS New UNESCO Java ISIS

The J-ISIS projectâ€™s mission and goals are to develop a new multiplatform Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ISIS suite that
would provide the same successful concepts and functionalities as the actual UNESCO ISIS suite while removing the restrictions,
being Client/Server, UNICODE, and benefiting of the latest software developments. One of the objectives was also to keep the assets
and experience of the users. But the main objective is also to develop a long-term solution that would be modular, 
easy maintainable and extensible.

J-ISIS uses NetBeans Platform framework for building a rich client application. It has its own Persistence Manager based on 
Oracle Berkeley NoSQL DB Java Edition for storing MARC structured records. It also includes a TCP/IP database server, an http web
server (embedded Jetty) and a web browser(JavaFX embedded browser) used for displaying records. J-ISIS uses Lucene to index and 
search databases. The ISIS powerful formatting language is used to extract terms or phrases for indexing. It can also be used for
formatting record display in HTML5.

You can easily create databases and populate them either through data entry or by importing data from external
files using standard formats for information interchange such as ISO-2709, MARC21, UNIMARC, MARCXML, MODS and Dublin Core. 
No need to be an expert in relational databases and SQL.
Records can be viewed, indexed, searched, edited and modified interactively or using batch processing. Selected, marked and 
search result records can be formatted, sorted and printed in HTML, PDF, etc. You can export data stored in the Persistence 
Manager into external files using standard formats for information interchange including ISO-2709, MARC21, UNIMARC, MARCXML,
MODS and Dublin Core. And much more ...
